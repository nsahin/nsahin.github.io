	<h1>Nil Sahin</h1>
	<p>I work as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.recursion.com/">Recursion Pharmaceuticals</a>, 
		by helping with our scientific software platforms to enable drug discovery.
		I enjoy implementing scientific algorithms, building computational tools and working in teams.
		I am proud of applying my science knowledge to healthcare, helping with combating diseases and improving the quality of our lives.
	</p>
	<p>I have a Ph.D. from the Department of <a href="http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca">Molecular Genetics</a>
		at the University of Toronto. I had been co-supervised by <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/andrewslab/index.shtml">Prof. Brenda Andrews</a> and 
		<a href="http://morrislab.ca">Prof. Quaid Morris</a>. 
		My <a href="/abstract/">thesis</a> focused on developing computational methods to automatically detect abnormalities due to mutations to better understand the gene function.
	</p>
	<p>In my free times, I love to do yoga, walk and make electronic music.
