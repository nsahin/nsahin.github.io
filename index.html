	<h1>Nil Sahin</h1>
	<p>I am a computational biologist pursuing a PhD in the Department of <a href="http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca">Molecular Genetics</a>
		at the University of Toronto. I am co-supervised by <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/andrewslab/index.shtml">Dr Brenda Andrews</a> and 
		<a href="http://morrislab.ca">Dr Quaid Morris</a>.
	</p>
	<p><li><a href="/abstract/">My PhD thesis</a></li> focuses on developing and implementing computer vision and machine learning approaches to analyze microscopy images to elucidate gene function.
		My analyses identify genetic mutations that have effects specific compartments in the cell that automatically provides novel functional information.
	</p>
	<p>I am passionate about conducting research, implementing algorithms, building tools, learning new techniques, working in and managing teams.
		I am also interested in applying my data science knowledge on healthcare to improve the quality of our lives and combat human diseases.
	</p>
	<p>In my free times, I love to do yoga, go on long walks, rock climb with friends, and make electronic music.
		Feel free to check out my music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nil-sahin">SoundCloud</a>.
