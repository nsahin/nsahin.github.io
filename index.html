	<h1>Nil Sahin</h1>
	<p>I am a computational biologist pursuing a PhD in the Department of <a href="http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca">Molecular Genetics</a>
		at the University of Toronto. I am co-supervised by <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/andrewslab/index.shtml">Dr Brenda Andrews</a> and 
		<a href="http://morrislab.ca">Dr Quaid Morris</a>.
	</p>
	<p>My PhD thesis focuses on developing and implementing computer vision and machine learning approaches to analyze microscopy images to elucidate gene function.
		My analyses identify genetic mutations that have an effect specific subcompartments in the cell that automatically provides novel functional information.
		By applying machine learning algorithms on cell images, I can accurately identify cells that have abnormal morphology due to mutations and subgroup these anomalies.
