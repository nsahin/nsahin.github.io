	<h1>Nil Sahin</h1>
	<p>I work as a computational scientist at <a href="https://www.cyclicarx.com/">Cyclica</a>, optimizing the scientific platforms for drug discovery. 
		I am passionate about implementing algorithms, building tools, conducting research and working in teams.
		I love applying my science knowledge to healthcare, to help with combating human diseases and improving the quality of our lives.
	</p>
	<p>I have PhD from the the Department of <a href="http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca">Molecular Genetics</a>
		at the University of Toronto. I had been co-supervised by <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/andrewslab/index.shtml">Prof. Brenda Andrews</a> and 
		<a href="http://morrislab.ca">Prof. Quaid Morris</a>. 
		My <a href="/abstract/">thesis</a> focuses on developing computational methods to automatically detect cellular abnormalities due to genetic mutations.
	</p>
	<p>In my free times, I love to meditate, do yoga, walk, and make electronic music.
